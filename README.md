## 🚨 Problem Statement

Despite the growing number of online learning platforms and events, verifying participation and preventing fraudulent claims remains a huge challenge. Certificates are:
- Easily forgeable 📝  
- Centralized and not verifiable 🔒  
- Lacking public visibility 🌍  
- Vulnerable to cheating during assessments ❌

## 💡 Our Approach & Solution

We built **CertiChain** to tackle this head-on using:
- 🧠 **AI** for detecting cheating during online quizzes  
- ⛓️ **Blockchain (NFTs)** for issuing immutable, tamper-proof certificates  
- 🧾 **Smart Contracts** to ensure ownership and authenticity  
- 💬 **Dashboard & UI** for easy access and public visibility

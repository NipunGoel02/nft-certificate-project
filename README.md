## üö® Problem Statement

Despite the growing number of online learning platforms and events, verifying participation and preventing fraudulent claims remains a huge challenge. Certificates are:

- Lacking public visibility üåç  
- Vulnerable to cheating during assessments ‚ùå

- üß† **AI** for detecting cheating during online quizzes  
- ‚õìÔ∏è **Blockchain (NFTs)** for issuing immutable, tamper-proof certificates  
- üßæ **Smart Contracts** to ensure ownership and authenticity
